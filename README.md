Single Page Websites
This is a repository containing single page websites built using HTML and CSS only. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my ability to create visually appealing and functional websites using only these two languages.

Websites
Each website has its own folder and contains an index.html file and a style.css file. The following websites are currently included:

Website 1: Image Gallery - A simple image gallery built using HTML and CSS. It displays a grid of images with a lightbox effect when clicked.

Website 2: Modern Chair - A website showcasing a modern chair design. It features a hero section with a background video, product information, and a contact form.

Website 3: Parallax Gaming - A parallax website about gaming, built using HTML and CSS. It features a unique design with scrolling parallax effects, game information, and a call-to-action section.

Website 4: Product Card - A product card for a mug, built using HTML and CSS. It displays an image of the product, pricing information, and an add-to-cart button.
